Takes an optional parameter amend which will be passed on to the git commit as an --amend flag, and to the git push as the --force flag.cf which will execute git checkout, but the passed-in branch is always prefixed with feature/.  The generated tool can be used like this  sgit acpsgit acp --amendsgit acp -asgit cf myFeature  This is it. Now you have a git macro that you can customize and tailor to your needs.  info CLiMAT uses a special DSL (Domain-specific language) for its scripts that has many more capabilities than what is showcased in the above example.
